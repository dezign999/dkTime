# dkTime for Watchy by SQFMI
This custom watch face is a labor of love and fan service to Nintendo. Donkey Kong was the first game I fell in love with, and I made sure to tell Mr. Shigeru Miyamoto this when I met him at the US unveiling of the Nintendo 64 in Los Angeles California.

dkTime is a port of my Pebble and Fitbit watch face of the same name. For the Watchy version, pressing the top left button will toggle 12 hour and 24 hour time display. Pressing the top and bottom right buttons will invoke a random Donkey Kong animation. Donkey Kong will perform 1 of 3 animation sequences every minute. 

Please note that while Donkey Kong is animating, button presses will be ignored for up to 2 seconds after the animation has completed. The last 2 seconds are screen udpates to reduce the Epaper residual ghosting.

Thanks to everyone in the SQFMI Discord for help in getting to this point, and an extra special thanks to Peerdavid for his code that I "borrowed" from his Watchy_base.cpp and Watchy_base.h files located at: https://github.com/peerdavid/Watchy
